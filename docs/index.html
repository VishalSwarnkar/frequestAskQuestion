<h3>Hello FAQ!!</h3>
  <div>
    <p><b>Q: What is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)?</b></p> 
        <p>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in <a href="/what-is-cloud-computing/">the cloud</a>. It is designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers.</p> 
        <p><b>Q: What can I do with Amazon EC2?</b></p> 
        <p>Just as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) enables storage in the cloud, Amazon EC2 enables “compute” in the cloud. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use.</p> 
        <p><b>Q: How can I get started with Amazon EC2?</b></p> 
        <p>To sign up for Amazon EC2, click the “Sign up for This Web Service” button on the Amazon EC2 detail page. You must have an Amazon Web Services account to access this service; if you do not already have one, you will be prompted to create one when you begin the Amazon EC2 sign-up process. After signing up, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ec2/index.html">Amazon EC2 documentation</a>, which includes our Getting Started Guide.</p> 
        <p><b>Q: Why am I asked to verify my phone number when signing up for Amazon EC2?</b></p> 
        <p>Amazon EC2 registration requires you to have a valid phone number and email address on file with AWS in case we ever need to contact you. Verifying your phone number takes only a couple of minutes and involves receiving a phone call during the registration process and entering a PIN number using the phone key pad.</p> 
        <p><b>Q: What can developers now do that they could not before?</b></p> 
        <p>Until now, small developers did not have the capital to acquire massive compute resources and ensure they had the capacity they needed to handle unexpected spikes in load. Amazon EC2 enables any developer to leverage Amazon’s own benefits of massive scale with no up-front investment or performance compromises. Developers are now free to innovate knowing that no matter how successful their businesses become, it will be inexpensive and simple to ensure they have the compute capacity they need to meet their business requirements.</p> 
        <p>The “Elastic” nature of the service allows developers to instantly scale to meet spikes in traffic or demand. When computing requirements unexpectedly change (up or down), Amazon EC2 can instantly respond, meaning that developers have the ability to control how many resources are in use at any given point in time. In contrast, traditional hosting services generally provide a fixed number of resources for a fixed amount of time, meaning that users have a limited ability to easily respond when their usage is rapidly changing, unpredictable, or is known to experience large peaks at various intervals.</p> 
        <p><b>Q: How do I run systems in the Amazon EC2 environment?</b></p> 
        <p>Once you have set up your account and select or create your AMIs, you are ready to boot your instance. You can start your AMI on any number of On-Demand instances by using the RunInstances API call. You simply need to indicate how many instances you wish to launch. If you wish to run more than 20 On-Demand instances, complete the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/ec2-request/">Amazon EC2 instance request form</a>.</p> 
        <p>If Amazon EC2 is able to fulfill your request, RunInstances will return success, and we will start launching your instances. You can check on the status of your instances using the DescribeInstances API call. You can also programmatically terminate any number of your instances using the TerminateInstances API call.</p> 
        <p>If you have a running instance using an Amazon EBS boot partition, you can also use the StopInstances API call to release the compute resources but preserve the data on the boot partition. You can use the StartInstances API when you are ready to restart the associated instance with the Amazon EBS boot partition.</p> 
        <p>In addition, you have the option to use Spot Instances to reduce your computing costs when you have flexibility in when your applications can run. Read more about Spot Instances for a more detailed explanation on how <a href="/ec2/spot/">Spot Instances</a> work.</p> 
        <p>If you prefer, you can also perform all these actions from the <a href="/console/">AWS Management Console</a> or through the command line using our command line tools, which have been implemented with this web service API.</p> 
        <p><b>Q: What is the difference between using the local instance store and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for the root device?</b></p> 
        <p>When you launch your Amazon EC2 instances you have the ability to store your root device data on Amazon EBS or the local instance store. By using Amazon EBS, data on the root device will persist independently from the lifetime of the instance. This enables you to stop and restart the instance at a subsequent time, which is similar to shutting down your laptop and restarting it when you need it again.</p> 
        <p>Alternatively, the local instance store only persists during the life of the instance. This is an inexpensive way to launch instances where data is not stored to the root device. For example, some customers use this option to run large web sites where each instance is a clone to handle web traffic.</p> 
        <p><b>Q: How quickly will systems be running?</b></p> 
        <p>It typically takes less than 10 minutes from the issue of the RunInstances call to the point where all requested instances begin their boot sequences. This time depends on a number of factors including: the size of your AMI, the number of instances you are launching, and how recently you have launched that AMI. Images launched for the first time may take slightly longer to boot.</p>
